    <p>"For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers."
        <br>Santrock, John W. (2008). Motor, Sensory, and Perceptual Development.</p>

    <p>
        "Most humans (say 70 percent to 95 percent) are right-handed, a minority (say 5 percent to 30 percent)
        are left-handed, and an indeterminate number of people are probably best described as ambidextrous."

    One of the robots is charged with a simple task:
    to join a sequence of strings into one sentence to produce instructions
    on how to get around the ship.
    But this robot is left-handed and has a tendency to joke around and confuse its right-handed friends.
</p>
<p>
    You are given a sequence of strings.
    You should join these strings into a chunk of text where the initial strings are separated by commas.
    As a joke on the right handed robots, you should replace all cases of the words "right" with the word "left",
    even if it's a part of another word. All strings are given in lowercase.

<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> A sequence of strings <span translate="no">(str{% if is_js %}ing{% endif %})</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong> The text as a comma-separated string <span translate="no">(str{% if is_js %}ing{% endif %})</span>.
